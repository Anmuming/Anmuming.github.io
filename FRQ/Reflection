From the beginning to the end of the exam, I have a certain understanding of my level of Java cognition. 
I can't say that I have answered every question correctly.
The FRQ questions can let me know clearly how much I have learned. Because of nervousness, 
I spent more than 1 hour and 30 minutes on the multiple-choice questions and FRQ questions. 
Unfortunately, I didn't finish all the FRQ.
